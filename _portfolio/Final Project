	For this project, I decided I wanted to focus on the intersection of housing and race in Baltimore City. I mainly wanted to look at demographics in different Baltimore City tracts and compare the percentage of Black populations to median household income, local affordable housing, and the percent of people in an area that own their houses or apartments. This topic is extremely important because as housing prices increase and buying homes becomes more difficult, some neighborhoods, particularly those with poor and minority populations, are more affected than other neighborhoods.   <br/><br/>
	
	This heightened burden on these communities is due to issues including historic disinvestment into these neighborhoods, loan discrimination, and redlining. For my other classes this semester, particularly Public Health and Urban Geography, I have previously written about this topic, specifically looking at past legislation such as the  Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 or the Fair Housing Act of 1968 which aimed to mitigate housing discrimination. Being able to visualize housing data for Baltimore City felt like a logical next step in my analysis of the housing market and its link to racial discrimination.    <br/><br/>

	Comparing the maps with one another highlights a correlation between the regions with higher Black populations and regions with overall lower median household incomes. The darker purple regions (indicating higher percentages of Black individuals) on the Black populations map generally line up with the lighter green regions (indicating regions with lower median household incomes) on the median household income map. This concept of Black populations having lower median household incomes than White populations is also highlighted in the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s study from January 2017 to December 2019, which found that in the state of Maryland, on average, Black workers in Maryland earn 78 cents per dollar that a White worker earned.  <br/><br/>
