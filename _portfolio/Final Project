	For this project, I decided I wanted to focus on the intersection of housing and race in Baltimore City. I mainly wanted to look at demographics in different Baltimore City tracts and compare the percentage of Black populations to median household income, local affordable housing, and the percent of people in an area that own their houses or apartments. This topic is extremely important because as housing prices increase and buying homes becomes more difficult, some neighborhoods, particularly those with poor and minority populations, are more affected than other neighborhoods.   <br/><br/>
	
	Comparing the maps with one another highlights a correlation between the regions with higher Black populations and regions with overall lower median household incomes. The darker purple regions (indicating higher percentages of Black individuals) on the Black populations map generally line up with the lighter green regions (indicating regions with lower median household incomes) on the median household income map. This concept of Black populations having lower median household incomes than White populations is also highlighted in the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s study from January 2017 to December 2019, which found that in the state of Maryland, on average, Black workers in Maryland earn 78 cents per dollar that a White worker earned.  <br/><br/>

	When comparing the correlation between Black population percentage and regions with overall lower median household incomes with the map centering on rent affordability, there is a slight connection between lower median household incomes and higher percentage of people spending more than 30% of their income on their rent. Though the connection between rent affordability and income is not as strong or apparent as the connection that can be drawn between Black population and income, the data on rent affordability is still important to consider. Regions where people are spending over 30% of their income on rent are significantly more likely to struggle with mental health issues, according to a study done by the National Library of Medicine. These regions are also more likely to struggle with food insecurity, transportation, and medical care. <br/><br/>

	Lastly, when looking at the correlation between owner-occupancy and Black populations there is a visible indication that regions with higher Black populations are more likely to have residents rent their housing as opposed to owning their housing units. When considering the previous data regarding the connections between Black populations, the racial wage gap, and lower median household incomes, it makes sense that regions with higher Black populations tend to also have higher populations of renters due to buying a house outright being more expensive than renting. A report done by the National Association of Realtors also supports this data, writing that as of 2021, approximately 44% of Black Americans were homeowners as opposed to the 72.7% of White Americans that were homeowners. <br/><br/> 

	Final Thoughts
	====== 
	
	During the course of this project, I thoroughly enjoyed being able to sit down and delve deeper and read research papers based on the topic I was mapping. I think in the future, it would be interesting to follow any alterations or additions to current housing legislation in Baltimore City and see how future legislation may improve rent affordability, housing unit ownership, or median household income in Baltimore City.
