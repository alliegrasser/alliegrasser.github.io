 With a Bachelor of Arts in Geography and Environmental Science, as well as a certificate in GIS, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to understanding and addressing the complex environmental and social issues facing our world. My skills in using ArcGIS Pro, ENVI, Inkscape, and QGIS make me well-equipped to analyze and visualize spatial data. My dedication to social justice issues also highlights my eagerness to use my skills for the greater good.

As someone who is passionate about making maps to contribute to the conversation about social justice issues and inequalities, I have a unique perspective on how geospatial data can be used to highlight disparities and advocate for change. My understand that maps are not just tools for navigation, but can also serve as powerful visualizations of complex social and environmental issues. Through my work, I hope to bring attention to issues such as access to resources, environmental justice, and equitable development, and to use my skills to help communities identify solutions to these challenges.
